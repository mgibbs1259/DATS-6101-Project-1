Research Question: Is there a significant linear relationship between school expenditure and 4th and 8th grade math test scores from 2000 to 2015?
H0: B1 = 0 
HA: B1 != 0

Packages
```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggvis)
library(grid)

```

Read in data
```{r}
finances <- fread("finances.csv")
scores <- fread("scores.csv")
```

Check data
```{r}
str(finances)
str(scores)
```

Clean data
```{r}
#choose columns of interest
finances <- finances[, c(1, 2, 4, 8)]
scores <- scores[, c(1:4)]
#select 2000 to 2015
finances <- finances[finances$YEAR > 2004 & finances$YEAR < 2016]
scores <- scores[scores$YEAR > 2004 & scores$YEAR < 2016]
#select mathematics
scores <- scores[scores$TEST_SUBJECT == 'Mathematics']
#join finances and scores on year and state
df <- merge(finances, scores, by = c("YEAR", "STATE"))
#make column names lowercase
df <- setnames(df, tolower(names(df)))
#remove rows with avg_score = "-" and avg_score = "‡"
df <- df[df$avg_score != "—" & df$avg_score != "‡"]
#change avg_score data type
df$avg_score <- as.numeric(df$avg_score, digits = 7)
#check df 
str(df)
```
